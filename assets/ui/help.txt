    "^5If you want to contact an administrator or just talk with other players, " 
    "connect via TeamSpeak 3 to 50.7.246.46:10011."
  }
  "^1Rules of the server^7"
  {
    "^1This service is provided free of charge without any guarantee. "
    "The server administrators reserve the right to decide what behavior is "
    "appropriate and who is allowed to use the service.^7\n"
    "^3Respect other players.^7\n"
    "No killing your team-mates (unless (s)he asks you to), "
    "no destroying your own team's buildings (unless moving etc.), "
    "no insulting other players, "
    "no spamming.\n"
    "You may not call a draw when one of the teams if making progress.\n"
    "Don't ask for admin privileges, you won't get any. Really."
  }
  "^3New building^7"
  {
    "Both teams can increase their build points by building so called "
    "human ^3refineries^7 and alien ^3creep colonies^7. Each of these "
    "buildings gives more build points to the team. "
    "The older building the more build points. "
    "The teams compete for build points, so by building more "
    "refineries/creep colonies, a team will steal build points from "
    "the other team.\n"
    "\n"
    "Creep colonies and refineries must be built at a given minimum distance from each "
    "other. So a team that camps will not be able to "
    "build more than a few refineries/creep colonies.\n"
    "\n"
    "Repeater zones have been removed. Repeaters now work only as power "
    "distributors.\n"
    "\n"
    "Creep and power now block each other. "
    "Humans cannot build on alien creep and aliens cannot build within power range.\n"
    "\n"
    "^5If your enemy camps, build them in and build a lot of creep colonies/refineries. "
    "This will starve them of build points.^7"
  }
  "^7Register^7"
  {
    "You can register your nickname by issuing ^3/register^7 command on the console."
  }
  "^7Armageddon^7"
  {
    "If the server is dying due to too many buildings, you can call an armageddon vote. "
    "If the vote passes, a given percent of turrets / teslas / acid tubes / hives is destroyed.\n"
    "Example: ^3/callvote armageddon 50^7\n"
    "If this vote passes, 50% of all defensive buildings both human and alien is immediately destroyed."
  }

  {
    "A dragoon pouncing into water fixed.\n"
  }
  "^7Head shots^7"
  {
    "Head shots are now visualized by blood drops. "
    "You see immediately if you made a head shot or not.\n"
    "If head shots disturb you, you can turn them off for yourself by ^3/set cg_bleedSelfHeadShots 0^7.\n\n"
    "Both humans and aliens bleed drops of blood when wounded.\n"
    "If this disturbs you, you can turn it off for yourself by ^3/set cg_bleedSelfWounds 0^7."
  }
  "^7Lucifer changes^7"
  {
    "When used near human buildings, the lucifer cannon bolt (primary fire) partly "
    "discharges into the nearest building. It damages both you and the building. "
    "Do not use it in your base!\n"
    "Secondary fire is safe, it doesn't discharge."

    "(while in a jump, for example) near the Overmind tranfers "
    "a certain part its healh to the Overmind.\n"
    "It cannot die this way, if its health is too low, no health is transferred."
  }
  "^7Basilisk changes^7"
  {
    "More features for basilisk to make it a usefull class.\n"
    "A regular basilisk's attack poisons the enemy for 5s, an advanced basilisk for 8s.\n"
    "Both basilisks are considerably resistant to flamethrower, a regular takes only 1/3 of damage, an advanced only 1/4 of damage.\n"
    "Basilisk is able to rotate its victim, so it can use the grabbed human as a meat shield.\n"
    "Basilisk is the only class that receies evos by staying alive even during sudden death."
  }
  "^7Sudden death^7"
  {
    "To prevent feeding by grangers when no building is allowed, spawning as grangers is disabled during sudden death.\n"
