Weapons of Mass Destruction
==================================

For a lot of build points (let's say 500) each team could construct a device that would destroy a big area of a map. It would take several minutes to build, at least 2, so that the other team has a chance to break out and destroy it. Maybe building it should be announced to both teams?. This would make camping games end faster (and more interesting too).

If destroyed before being finished, it would do only much smaller damage (or no damage?).

Starting it should cost let's say 100 BPs and the rest of BPs should be drained gradually as it is being built. Whether it is activated or disarmed, the build points consumed would be returned to the build point queue.

The new buildings should be available at newly introduced Stage 4.

For **humans** it could be a nuke device - a large bomb that wipes out all players and buildings in a large radius. Suggested bulding name: *Nuclear bomb*.

For **aliens** it could be "a research for a virus" that would infest human buildings in the area. It could make turrets target other human buildings and players, perhaps medi-stations to poison humans etc. It could be contagious so that an infested building infect other nearby ones. Suggested building name: *Nanovirus chamber*.
